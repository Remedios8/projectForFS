    <h4>The Sydney Opera House is a multi-venue performing arts centre in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. It is
        one of the 20th century's most famous and distinctive buildings.</h4>

    <h5 style="text-align: right">Designed by Danish architect JÃ¸rn Utzon, the building was formally opened on 20
        October 1973[4] after a gestation
        beginning with Utzon's 1957 selection as winner of an international design competition. The government of New
        South
        Wales, led by the premier, Joseph Cahill, authorised work to begin in 1958 with Utzon directing construction.
        The
        government's decision to build Utzon's design is often overshadowed by circumstances that followed, including
        cost
        and scheduling overruns as well as the architect's ultimate resignation.</h5>
